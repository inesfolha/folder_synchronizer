# Synchronizer üìÅ
<p id="top"></p>

## Description
Synchronizer is a program that synchronizes two folders: source and replica, maintaining an identical copy of source folder at replica folder:

- Synchronization works one-way: after the synchronization, the content of the
replica folder is modified to exactly match content of the source
folder;
- Synchronization is performed periodically within an interval of seconds set by the user.
- File creation/copying/removal operations are logged to a file and to the
console;
- Errors are logged to a file and to the console with custom messages.
- Folder paths, synchronization interval and logs directory should be provided
using the command line arguments;
- If the replica folder with the specified path does not exist, one will be created.

### Running the Program

To run the program, open a command line terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file. Use the following command format to execute the program:

```bash
# On Windows
python main.py --source "C:\path\to\source\folder" --replica "C:\path\to\replica\folder" --interval 30 --log_folder "logs"
```
```bash
# On Linux or MacOS
python3 main.py --source "path/to/source/folder" --replica "path/to/replica/folder" --interval 30 --log_folder "logs"
```
Replace the following placeholders with your specific values

- path/to/source/folder: The full path to the source folder you want to synchronize.
- path/to/replica/folder: The full path to the replica folder where changes will be mirrored.
- 60: The synchronization interval in seconds. Adjust this value according to your synchronization requirements.
- logs: The directory where log files will be stored. Modify this as needed.

### Stopping the Program
To stop the program, press Ctrl + C in the terminal. This will send a keyboard interrupt signal to the program, gracefully stopping its execution.
